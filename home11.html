C.P. Brown

            Charies Philip Brown stands out prominently among European Scholars who contributed to Telugu studies.  His service to
 Telugu in different branches like grammar, prosody, and critical studies of the Telugu classics is epoch making.  As a lexicographer
, he undertook the laborious task of compiling two standard dictionaries.  He was the first Indologist to publish Telugu Classics with commentaries.
  He collected a large number of palm-leaf manuscripts from the most remote corners of Telugu-speaking areas and employed about twenty pundits, at
 his own expense, to transcribe, provide indexes and commentaries and the much needed historical backgrounds for such ancient texts.  He also helped
 in bringing out fascinating insights of the language with the assistance of the pundits he worked with.  He gave to the ancient texts a standard and
 authenticity that had not existed earlier.

            Besides putting in strenuous efforts in collecting, correcting  and editing of Telugu literary texts, he also contributed to the growth of
 the ‘Kavya’ (literary dialect) and the much neglected ‘Vyavaharika'(spoken dialect) and attempted to effect a synthesis between the two by fostering 
democratic processes, that were long absent on the Telugu literary scene.  The literary culture in Andhra was at its lowest ebb at that time.  As he
 himself recalls, “Telugu literature was dying out, the flame was flickering in the socket”.  It was at such a time that Brown dedicated himself with 
missionary zeal to revive the  ancient heritage.  For this reason, he may be aptly described as the Father of the Renaissance in Telugu.

            Charles Philip Brown was born in Calcutta on November 10, 1798.  His father Rev, David Brown was Senior Chaplain of the East India Company 
in Bengal.  After the death of Rev. David Brown in 1812, the family moved to London. The young Brown was educated at Hailey bury College and later took up 
service in the East India Company.
	Even in the midst of his official responsibilities and consequent difficulties, compounded with professional jealousy and the dishonesty and apathy
 of his own countrymen, Brown stuck to his Telugu studies and in consequence, remained contentedly poor.  He wrote in his diary, “Want of leisure so often 
lamented in India usually denote want of iodination. I have always had leisure”.  All his leisure was devoted to his studies in single concentration of
 purpose and accomplishment.
